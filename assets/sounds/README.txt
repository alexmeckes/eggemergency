Sound Files Directory

This directory would normally contain the following sound files:
- egg_spawn.mp3: Sound when a new egg appears
- egg_catch.mp3: Sound when a Chansey catches an egg
- egg_break.mp3: Sound when an egg hits the ground and breaks
- bomb_catch.mp3: Sound when a bomb egg is caught
- game_start.mp3: Fanfare when the game starts
- game_over.mp3: Sound when the game ends
- egg_emergency_theme.mp3: Background music for the game

Since these files are not included, the game generates audio procedurally using Web Audio API oscillators.
